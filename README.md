VR_Project_2 Post-Project Testing

Pre-Questions
1. Have you pressed buttons in VR before and where?
2. What unique UI's exist within VR games or interfaces where buttons make an impact?
3. When you press a button, what type of feedback would you ideally like to receive?

Post-Questions
1. Which method of pressing did you like the best?
2. Can you relate any of the methods to uses you would use in an actual VR interface (game or regular UI)?
3. Did any of the buttons feel awkward or complicated to use/press?

Tester 1: Nathan Khazam

Pre:
1. I have. Many games using buttons and physical movements.
2. Physically moving out to touch them rather them pressing with a controller.
3. A sound feedback or vibration from the controller to initiate a press.

Post:
1. I liked the physical one despite button technical issues.
2. All of them could be used. Progressing through levels or a puzzle game.
3. None of them felt awkward, but a indicator on the Raycast button would have been nice.

Tester #2: Patrick Hunt

Pre:
1. Yes, in this class, and superhot
2. Situations where you have to toggle or use an ability
3. Haptic

Post:
1. The first one cause it resembles an actual button
2. Definitely, the 2nd one could be used to universally point at an object such as in shooters
3. The first one for technical issues, but the 3rd could use an indicator.

Tester #3: Ari Guzzi

Pre: 
1. Yes, only in class
2. Usually when I interact in environments like in Mario or Portal
3. Depends what I'm doing If i'm picking something up, haptic would be nice.

Post:
1. I liked the first one, pressing the button itself was nice
2. The last one I couldn't really imagine being in a game but the other 2 were cool
3. THe 2nd one was a tiny bit awkward, the first one was not as intuitive as I would've liked it to be

Tester #4: Nathan Keyt

Pre: 
1. Played like Superhot and VR Chat and Beat Saber
2. VR demo experiences, VR chat, VR are physical buttons
3. I want it to feel like an authentic; sound feedback, the button pushes down. 

Post:
1. The last one felt the most polished but pressing the button actually was the coolest
2. The hover one as a button hand scan hand hold like in security games or movies
3. The raycast one didn't seem like it was triggering but there was no feedback. 

Tester #5: Sam Horying

Pre:
1. Yeah I'm pretty sure
2. Varying buttons can make an impact on gameplay and unique UI experiences
3. I like to tell very easily what I did, if possible, make it kind of satisfying

Post:
1. The first one, I liked physically pressing the button 
2. All 3 so far within using VR
3. The second one, with no indicator.
