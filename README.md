VR_Project_2 Post-Project Testing

Pre-Questions
1. Have you pressed buttons in VR before and where?
2. What unique UI's exist within VR games or interfaces where buttons make an impact?
3. When you press a button, what type of feedback would you ideally like to receive?

Post-Questions
1. Which method of pressing did you like the best?
2. Can you relate any of the methods to uses you would use in an actual VR interface (game or regular UI)?
3. Did any of the buttons feel awkward or complicated to use/press?

Tester 1: Nathan Khazam

Pre:
1. I have. Many games using buttons and physical movements.
2. Physically moving out to touch them rather them pressing with a controller.
3. A sound feedback or vibration from the controller to initiate a press.

Post:
1. I liked the physical one despite button technical issues.
2. All of them could be used. Progressing through levels or a puzzle game.
3. None of them felt awkward, but a indicator on the Raycast button would have been nice.

Tester #2: Patrick Hunt

Pre:
1. Yes, in this class, and superhot
2. Situations where you have to toggle or use an ability
3. Haptic

Post:
1. The first one cause it resembles an actual button
2. Definitely, the 2nd one could be used to universally point at an object such as in shooters
3. The first one for technical issues, but the 3rd could use an indicator.
