# 1. What interaction are you exploring?

#   Pushing Buttons

# 2. What 3 different ways are you going to implement it?

#   1. Direct Touching: VR Haptic Feedback to register feedback on your hand when you press a button, it plays celebration music and does streamer effects

#   2. Distance Touching: Some type of laser pointer to detect proiximity to the button. Haptic feedback would be the button changing color and you press trigger to press the button

#   3. Hover Touching: Rather then pressing down on the button to activate it directly, hover over it and haptic feedback would initiate a progress glow bar to complete activation of the button. 

# I would like to think of more and expand on this if I have time, but these are cool modern ways to press a button that's present in games. #1 is done all the time in games and the main oculus interface. #2 is implemented all the time in games where your in the main screen and a pointer is pointing to UI options like "Start Game", "Campaign" etc. #3 is present all the time in games where you can walk and interact with the environment and hover over a button or an object and it will activate.
