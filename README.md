# 1. What interaction are you exploring?

#   Pushing Buttons

# 2. What 3 different ways are you going to implement it?

#   1. Direct Touching: VR Haptic Feedback to register feedback on your hand when you press a button, it plays celebration music and does streamer effects

#   2. Distance Touching: Some type of laser pointer to detect proiximity to the button. Haptic feedback would be the button changing color and you press trigger to press the button

#   3. Hover Touching: Rather then pressing down on the button to activate it directly, hover over it and haptic feedback would initiate a progress glow bar to complete activation of the button. 

# I would like to think of more and expand on this if I have time, but these are cool modern ways to press a button that's present in games. #1 is done all the time in games and the main oculus interface. #2 is implemented all the time in games where your in the main screen and a pointer is pointing to UI options like "Start Game", "Campaign" etc. #3 is present all the time in games where you can walk and interact with the environment and hover over a button or an object and it will activate. 

Pre-Questions
1. Have you pressed buttons in VR before and where?
2. What unique UI's exist within VR games or interfaces where buttons make an impact?
3. When you press a button, what type of feedback would you ideally like to receive?

Post-Questions
1. Which method of pressing did you like the best?
2. Can you relate any of the methods to uses you would use in an actual VR interface (game or regular UI)?
3. Did any of the buttons feel awkward or complicated to use/press?

Tester 1: Nathan Khazam

Pre:
1. I have. Many games using buttons and physical movements.
2. Physically moving out to touch them rather them pressing with a controller.
3. A sound feedback or vibration from the controller to initiate a press.

Post:
1. I liked the physical one despite button technical issues.
2. All of them could be used. Progressing through levels or a puzzle game.
3. None of them felt awkward, but a indicator on the Raycast button would have been nice.
